# Strange-Attractor

The above code demonstrates the primary principle behind chaos theory with an example of a strange attractor. The state of a chaotic system will be local unstable,
but will be globally stable demonstrated by how the points never move beyond the strange attractor shape. The actual shape is determined using the differential
equations of Lorenz, so this is the Lorenz Strange Attractor. The code uses the Three.js library and allows for rotation of the camera with the left mouse click and drag,
movement of the camera laterally with the right mouse click and drag, and zooming by pinching with 2 fingers. The strange attractor will also change colour randomly when 
the mouse touches any of the trails. This was a 3D coding project to experiment with using the three.js library and was coded in javascript. Download the three.js folder in order for the project to run.
